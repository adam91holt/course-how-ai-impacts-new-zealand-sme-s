Now that you understand what artificial intelligence is, let's explore the specific types of AI technologies that are most relevant for New Zealand SMEs. Each category offers distinct capabilities that can address different business challenges.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the main categories of AI technology relevant to SMEs
- Explain what each type of AI does and its business applications
- Match AI technology types to common SME business needs
- Evaluate which AI categories might benefit your specific business

## Generative AI

Generative AI has captured global attention since ChatGPT launched in late 2022. This category of AI creates new content—text, images, audio, and video—based on patterns learned from existing content.

### Text Generation
Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google's Gemini can write emails, create marketing copy, draft reports, summarise documents, and answer questions. For NZ SMEs, this means:
- Drafting professional customer communications without hiring a copywriter
- Creating product descriptions for e-commerce sites
- Generating social media content calendars
- Writing job advertisements and policy documents

### Image Generation
Tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion create images from text descriptions. Applications for SMEs include:
- Creating marketing visuals without expensive photography
- Generating product mockups and concepts
- Designing social media graphics
- Visualising ideas for client presentations

> **Tip:** When using generative AI for customer-facing content, always review and edit the output. AI can make mistakes or produce content that doesn't match your brand voice.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. This technology powers many tools SMEs use daily.

### Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
NLP drives chatbots that can handle customer enquiries, book appointments, and provide product information. A Wellington-based physiotherapy clinic might use a chatbot to schedule appointments after hours, freeing up reception staff during busy periods.

### Sentiment Analysis
NLP can analyse customer reviews, social media mentions, and survey responses to gauge customer sentiment. This helps SMEs understand how customers feel about their products and services at scale.

### Translation
NLP powers real-time translation tools, enabling NZ businesses to communicate with international customers and suppliers. A Christchurch exporter can use AI translation to communicate with customers across Asia and Europe.

### Voice Recognition
Virtual assistants and voice-to-text tools use NLP to understand spoken language. This enables hands-free operation for tradespeople, faster note-taking in meetings, and accessibility features for customers with disabilities.

## Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics

Machine learning systems identify patterns in historical data to make predictions about future events. This category is particularly powerful for business decision-making.

### Demand Forecasting
ML can predict future demand based on historical sales, seasonal patterns, and external factors. A Tauranga-based fruit processor can optimise inventory and staffing based on predicted volumes.

### Customer Behaviour Prediction
ML models can predict which customers are likely to churn, what products they might buy next, or how they'll respond to marketing campaigns. This enables more targeted, effective marketing spend.

### Price Optimisation
Dynamic pricing powered by ML helps businesses optimise prices based on demand, competition, and other factors. Accommodation providers in tourist areas commonly use this technology.

### Risk Assessment
ML can assess credit risk, fraud risk, and operational risks based on pattern recognition in historical data.

## Computer Vision

Computer vision enables computers to interpret and act on visual information from images and video.

### Quality Control
Manufacturing SMEs can use computer vision to inspect products for defects faster and more consistently than human inspectors. A food processing company might use it to identify damaged produce on a conveyor belt.

### Document Processing
Computer vision combined with optical character recognition (OCR) can extract information from invoices, receipts, and forms. This automates data entry and reduces errors.

### Security and Monitoring
Computer vision powers smart security cameras that can identify unusual activity, count people, and monitor premises without constant human attention.

### Agricultural Applications
NZ's primary sector increasingly uses computer vision for crop monitoring, livestock health assessment, and yield prediction. A Hawke's Bay vineyard might use drone imagery and computer vision to identify disease early.

## Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

While not always considered "true AI," RPA often incorporates AI capabilities and deserves mention for its practical business applications.

### Data Entry Automation
RPA bots can copy data between systems, fill out forms, and update records—tasks that consume significant staff time in many SMEs.

### Report Generation
Automated report generation pulls data from multiple sources and creates formatted reports on schedule, ensuring decision-makers have current information.

### Process Automation
Multi-step business processes can be automated end-to-end. When an order comes in, RPA can check inventory, generate a pick list, update the accounting system, and send a confirmation email—all without human intervention.

## AI-Powered Analytics

Modern analytics platforms incorporate AI to surface insights that would be difficult or impossible to find manually.

### Anomaly Detection
AI can identify unusual patterns in business data—a sudden spike in returns, unusual access patterns that might indicate fraud, or equipment readings that suggest impending failure.

### Automated Insights
Rather than requiring users to know what questions to ask, AI-powered analytics can proactively surface relevant insights. "Your sales in Otago are 23% below trend—here's why."

### Data Visualisation
AI can recommend the most effective ways to visualise data and automatically generate charts and dashboards.

## Matching AI to Business Needs

Different business challenges call for different AI approaches:

| Business Challenge | Relevant AI Type |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Customer enquiries overwhelming staff | NLP Chatbots, Generative AI |
| Need more marketing content | Generative AI (text and image) |
| Unpredictable inventory needs | Machine Learning forecasting |
| Manual data entry taking too much time | RPA, Computer Vision (OCR) |
| Quality control bottlenecks | Computer Vision |
| Understanding customer sentiment | NLP Sentiment Analysis |
| Making sense of business data | AI-Powered Analytics |

## Key Takeaways

- Generative AI creates new content (text, images, audio) and is highly accessible for SMEs
- Natural Language Processing enables chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis
- Machine Learning excels at prediction and pattern recognition from historical data
- Computer Vision interprets visual information for quality control, security, and agriculture
- RPA automates repetitive digital tasks across multiple systems
- Different business challenges require different types of AI technology

## Next Steps

With an understanding of AI types, our next lesson examines the specific New Zealand AI landscape—local providers, government initiatives, and how Kiwi businesses are adopting these technologies.
