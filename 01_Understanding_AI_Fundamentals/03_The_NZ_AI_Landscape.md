# The New Zealand AI Landscape

Understanding the local context is crucial for NZ SMEs looking to adopt AI. This lesson explores New Zealand's unique position in the global AI ecosystem, local providers and initiatives, and how Kiwi businesses are currently engaging with AI technology.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe New Zealand's current position in AI adoption and development
- Identify key NZ-based AI companies and resources
- Explain government initiatives supporting AI adoption in NZ businesses
- Recognise the unique opportunities and challenges for AI in the New Zealand context

## New Zealand's AI Position

New Zealand occupies an interesting position in the global AI landscape. While we're not a major AI development hub like the United States or China, we have several advantages that make us well-positioned for AI adoption.

### Our Strengths

**High Digital Literacy**
New Zealand consistently ranks highly in digital readiness indices. Our population is comfortable with technology, making AI adoption easier than in many countries.

**Strong Research Base**
Universities including Auckland, Canterbury, Victoria, and Otago have active AI research programmes. These institutions are producing graduates with AI skills and conducting research relevant to NZ industries.

**Regulatory Environment**
New Zealand's business-friendly regulatory environment and strong rule of law make it attractive for testing and deploying AI applications. Several international companies use NZ as a test market.

**Industry Opportunities**
Our primary industries—agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture—present unique AI applications. NZ companies are developing world-leading AI solutions for these sectors.

### Our Challenges

**Small Market**
Our population of 5 million limits the market for locally-developed AI solutions, meaning many Kiwi AI companies must export to survive.

**Talent Competition**
NZ AI talent is in high demand globally. Retaining skilled AI professionals is challenging when they can earn significantly more overseas.

**Infrastructure Gaps**
While urban areas have good connectivity, rural areas—where many primary industries operate—can lack the reliable internet needed for cloud-based AI services.

**Distance from Markets**
Geographic isolation adds complexity for NZ AI companies trying to serve international markets and for SMEs trying to access support from overseas AI vendors.

## NZ-Based AI Companies and Solutions

A growing ecosystem of New Zealand companies is developing AI solutions relevant to SMEs.

### Soul Machines
Auckland-based Soul Machines creates digital humans—AI-powered avatars that can interact naturally with customers. Their technology is used by major brands globally for customer service and marketing.

### Imagr
This Auckland company developed computer vision technology for retail—smart shopping carts that automatically identify products, eliminating checkout queues.

### Halter
Halter produces AI-powered solar collars for dairy cattle that enable virtual fencing and animal health monitoring. This represents NZ innovation in applying AI to our agricultural sector.

### Xero
While primarily an accounting platform, Xero (founded in Wellington) increasingly incorporates AI for features like automated bank reconciliation, invoice coding, and cash flow prediction—directly benefiting NZ SMEs.

### Hnry
This Wellington company uses AI to automate tax calculations and payments for contractors and freelancers, solving a common pain point for NZ's growing gig economy.

### FarmIQ and Figured
Agricultural management platforms using AI to help farmers with everything from feed planning to financial forecasting.

> **Tip:** Supporting NZ-based AI companies can provide advantages including local support, understanding of NZ regulations (like GST and employment law), and solutions designed for Kiwi business contexts.

## Government Initiatives and Support

The New Zealand government has recognised AI's importance and launched several initiatives relevant to SMEs.

### AI Forum of New Zealand
The AI Forum brings together businesses, researchers, and government to advance AI adoption. They produce valuable research including reports on AI's economic impact and guidelines for responsible AI use.

### Digital Boost
This government initiative provides free digital skills training including AI fundamentals. SME owners and staff can access online learning modules covering AI applications in business.

### Callaghan Innovation
Callaghan offers R&D grants and support for businesses developing innovative technology, including AI applications. If your SME is developing proprietary AI solutions, their funding and advisory services may be valuable.

### NZTE Support
New Zealand Trade and Enterprise provides resources for businesses looking to export AI-enabled products and services, or to adopt AI to improve export competitiveness.

### Regional Business Partner Network
This network can connect SMEs with local advisors who understand AI opportunities and help identify appropriate funding and support programmes.

## Current State of AI Adoption in NZ SMEs

Research from the AI Forum and other sources reveals patterns in how Kiwi SMEs are engaging with AI.

### Adoption Rates

Adoption varies significantly by industry and business size. Professional services firms show higher adoption rates, while traditional industries like manufacturing and hospitality lag behind. However, the gap is closing as AI tools become more accessible.

### Common Entry Points

Most NZ SMEs begin their AI journey with:
1. **Generative AI for content** - Using ChatGPT or similar for marketing copy and communications
2. **Accounting AI features** - Automated coding and reconciliation in Xero or MYOB
3. **Customer service chatbots** - Simple website chatbots handling FAQs
4. **Marketing automation** - AI-powered email marketing and social media tools

### Barriers to Adoption

NZ SMEs report several common barriers:
- **Uncertainty about where to start** - Overwhelmed by options and unsure what's relevant
- **Cost concerns** - Worry about subscription costs adding up
- **Data quality issues** - Recognising their data isn't organised enough to leverage AI
- **Skills gaps** - Lacking staff with AI expertise
- **Time constraints** - Too busy running the business to evaluate and implement new tools

### Success Factors

SMEs succeeding with AI typically share certain characteristics:
- They start with a specific business problem rather than adopting AI for its own sake
- They invest time in proper setup and training rather than expecting instant results
- They designate someone to champion the AI initiative internally
- They measure results and iterate based on what works

## NZ-Specific Considerations

Several factors make the NZ context unique for AI adoption.

### Te Ao Māori and AI
Discussions about AI in New Zealand increasingly consider Māori perspectives. Concepts like kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and data sovereignty are relevant to how NZ businesses should approach AI ethics and data use. Some initiatives are exploring how AI might support te reo Māori preservation and Māori business development.

### Privacy Act Compliance
New Zealand's Privacy Act 2020 affects how businesses can collect, use, and store personal information—including for AI applications. Understanding these requirements is essential before implementing AI that processes customer data.

### Small Business Focus
With 97% of NZ businesses having fewer than 20 employees, AI solutions designed for enterprise needs may not fit well. The most successful AI adoption often comes from tools designed with small business constraints in mind.

### Seasonal and Geographic Factors
Many NZ businesses deal with strong seasonality (tourism, agriculture) and geographic spread. AI tools need to accommodate these realities, such as predicting demand during peak tourist season or operating in areas with limited connectivity.

## Key Takeaways

- New Zealand has strong foundations for AI adoption including high digital literacy and good research institutions
- A growing ecosystem of NZ-based AI companies offers locally-relevant solutions
- Government programmes provide training, funding, and support for SME AI adoption
- Current adoption is growing but uneven across industries
- Te Ao Māori perspectives and Privacy Act compliance are important NZ-specific considerations
