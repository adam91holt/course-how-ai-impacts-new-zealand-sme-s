# Assessing Your AI Readiness

Before investing in AI tools, it's essential to honestly evaluate whether your business is ready to benefit from them. Not every SME is at the same starting point, and understanding your current state helps you focus investments where they'll deliver the best returns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Conduct an AI readiness assessment for your business
- Identify gaps that need addressing before AI implementation
- Evaluate your data quality and availability
- Assess your team's capability and appetite for AI
- Create a prioritised roadmap for AI adoption

## Why Readiness Matters

Jumping into AI without preparation often leads to:
- Wasted money on tools that don't fit your needs
- Frustrated staff struggling with poorly implemented systems
- Disappointing results that sour the business on AI generally
- Security and privacy risks from hasty implementation

Conversely, businesses that assess readiness first typically see:
- Faster time to value from AI investments
- Higher staff adoption and satisfaction
- Better alignment between AI tools and business needs
- Reduced risk of implementation failure

> **Important:** AI readiness isn't about being perfect—it's about understanding where you are and what needs attention. Many successful AI implementations start from modest foundations.

## The AI Readiness Framework

Assess your business across five key dimensions:

### 1. Strategic Clarity

**Key Questions:**
- What specific business problems do you want AI to solve?
- What does success look like, and how will you measure it?
- How does AI fit with your broader business strategy?
- What's driving your interest in AI—competitive pressure, efficiency needs, customer expectations?

**Why It Matters:**
Without clear objectives, AI becomes a solution looking for a problem. SMEs with specific, measurable goals achieve better results than those pursuing AI vaguely.

**Red Flags:**
- "We should do something with AI because everyone else is"
- Inability to articulate specific problems AI would solve
- No clear metrics for measuring success

**Green Lights:**
- Specific, prioritised list of problems to solve
- Clear success metrics defined
- Understanding of how AI supports broader strategy

### 2. Data Foundations

AI systems learn from and operate on data. Your data quality directly affects AI performance.

**Key Questions:**
- What business data do you currently collect and store?
- How accurate, complete, and consistent is your data?
- Can you access your data in useful formats?
- How long is your data history in key areas?

**Assessment Areas:**

*Customer Data*
- Do you have centralised customer records?
- How complete are contact details and interaction history?
- Can you identify individual customers across touchpoints?

*Transaction Data*
- Are sales and financial records complete and accurate?
- How far back does your history go?
- Can you analyse by product, customer, time period?

*Operational Data*
- Do you track key operational metrics?
- Is process data captured systematically?
- Can you analyse patterns in operations?

**Common Data Gaps in NZ SMEs:**
- Information scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and paper
- Inconsistent data entry practices
- Missing historical data from before current systems
- Poor integration between different software systems

**Improving Data Foundations:**
- Audit what data you have and where it lives
- Establish consistent data entry standards
- Consolidate data into appropriate systems
- Start capturing data you'll need for future AI applications

### 3. Technology Infrastructure

AI tools need to connect with your existing technology ecosystem.

**Key Questions:**
- What core business systems do you use? (Accounting, CRM, POS, etc.)
- How well do your systems integrate with each other?
- Do your systems support modern integrations (APIs)?
- What's your internet connectivity and reliability?

**Assessment Checklist:**

| System Type | Questions to Ask |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Accounting | Xero, MYOB, or other? Cloud-based? API access? |
| CRM | Do you have one? What platform? Integration capability? |
| Website/E-commerce | Platform? Analytics enabled? Integration options? |
| Communication | Email platform? Marketing automation? |
| Operations | Scheduling tools? Project management? |

**Infrastructure Improvements:**
- Migrate from legacy systems to modern, cloud-based platforms
- Establish key integrations between core systems
- Ensure reliable internet connectivity
- Consider mobile accessibility for staff

### 4. Skills and Culture

AI implementation succeeds or fails based on people.

**Key Questions:**
- How comfortable is your team with technology generally?
- Is there appetite for learning new tools?
- Who would champion AI initiatives internally?
- How does your culture respond to change?

**Capability Assessment:**

*Digital Literacy*
Rate your team's overall comfort with:
- Using software tools daily
- Learning new applications
- Troubleshooting basic technology issues
- Working with data and spreadsheets

*Change Readiness*
Consider how your organisation typically responds to:
- New processes and procedures
- New technology implementations
- Training and learning requirements
- Uncertainty during transitions

*AI Awareness*
Gauge current understanding of:
- What AI is and isn't
- How AI might apply to your business
- Concerns and questions about AI
- Interest in learning more

**Building Readiness:**
- Provide basic AI awareness training
- Identify and develop internal champions
- Address concerns and misconceptions proactively
- Create psychological safety for experimentation

### 5. Resources and Capacity

Implementation requires time, money, and attention.

**Key Questions:**
- What budget is available for AI tools and implementation?
- Who has time to lead implementation efforts?
- Can you afford productivity dips during transition?
- What external support might you need?

**Resource Considerations:**

*Financial*
- Monthly subscription budgets
- One-time implementation costs
- Training and support expenses
- Potential external consulting

*Time*
- Research and tool selection
- Implementation and configuration
- Staff training
- Ongoing management and optimisation

*Attention*
- Who will own AI initiatives?
- How much leadership focus is available?
- Can you sustain attention through implementation challenges?

- Ongoing

## Case Study: From Assessment to Action

**Kiwi Manufacturing Ltd** (fictional composite)

A 15-person manufacturing business in Hamilton assessed their AI readiness:

**Assessment Results:**
- Strategic Clarity: 4/5 (clear goals for quoting and scheduling)
- Data Foundations: 2/5 (data scattered, inconsistent quality)
- Technology: 3/5 (decent systems, poor integration)
- Skills: 3/5 (competent team, limited AI awareness)
- Resources: 3/5 (modest budget, owner willing to lead)

**Action Plan:**
1. **Foundation (2 months):** Consolidated data into their CRM, established data entry standards, connected accounting and project management systems
2. **Quick Wins (1 month):** Implemented ChatGPT for quote drafting, enabled Xero's AI features
3. **Expansion (ongoing):** Planned implementation of AI scheduling tool once data foundation was solid

**Key Insight:** Rather than jumping to advanced AI scheduling (their main goal), they recognised that poor data would undermine any AI tool. Two months of data foundation work set them up for success.
