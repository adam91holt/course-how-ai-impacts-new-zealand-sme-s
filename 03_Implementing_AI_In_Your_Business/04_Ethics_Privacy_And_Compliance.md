AI adoption brings significant responsibilities. How you use AI affects your customers, staff, and community. In New Zealand, specific legal requirements govern how businesses handle data and make automated decisions. This lesson helps you navigate the ethical and legal landscape of AI use.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Apply ethical principles to AI decision-making in your business
- Ensure compliance with New Zealand's Privacy Act 2020
- Implement appropriate data handling practices for AI systems
- Navigate transparency and fairness requirements
- Develop responsible AI policies for your organisation

## Why Ethics and Compliance Matter

AI ethics and compliance aren't just about avoiding legal trouble—they're about:

**Trust:** Customers and staff need to trust how you use AI. Breaches of trust cause lasting damage.

**Fairness:** AI can perpetuate or amplify biases. Responsible use requires attention to fair outcomes.

**Legal Obligation:** NZ law places specific requirements on data handling and automated decision-making.

**Competitive Advantage:** Businesses known for responsible AI use build stronger relationships.

> **Important:** "We didn't know" isn't a defence. As you adopt AI, educating yourself about ethical and legal requirements is your responsibility.

## Ethical Principles for AI Use

### Transparency

**Principle:** Be open about when and how you use AI.

**In Practice:**
- Tell customers when they're interacting with a chatbot
- Disclose AI involvement in significant decisions
- Explain how AI-generated content was created
- Don't pretend AI output is human work

**Example:** If your website uses an AI chatbot, clearly label it as automated. "Hi! I'm an AI assistant. I can help with common questions, or connect you with a human for complex issues."

### Fairness

**Principle:** AI should not discriminate or produce systematically unfair outcomes.

**In Practice:**
- Check AI outputs for bias patterns
- Be especially careful with AI affecting hiring, credit, or service access
- Monitor for disparate impact on different customer groups
- Question AI recommendations that seem unfair

**Example:** If using AI for customer risk scoring, verify it doesn't unfairly disadvantage certain demographic groups.

### Accountability

**Principle:** Humans remain responsible for AI outcomes.

**In Practice:**
- Maintain human oversight of significant AI decisions
- Don't blame AI for poor outcomes
- Have clear escalation paths when AI fails
- Document AI decision-making processes

**Example:** If AI recommends declining a customer application, a human should review borderline cases. If the AI is wrong, your business—not the AI—is responsible.

### Privacy

**Principle:** Protect personal information in AI systems.

**In Practice:**
- Collect only data you need
- Store data securely
- Use data only for stated purposes
- Allow people to access and correct their data

### Human Dignity

**Principle:** AI should support human flourishing, not diminish it.

**In Practice:**
- Don't use AI in ways that demean or manipulate
- Ensure AI augments rather than replaces human connection where it matters
- Consider impacts on staff wellbeing
- Avoid deceptive AI practices

## New Zealand Privacy Act 2020

The Privacy Act 2020 governs how NZ businesses collect, use, store, and disclose personal information. AI systems that process personal information must comply.

### Key Requirements

**Information Privacy Principles (IPPs)**

The Act contains 13 Information Privacy Principles. Key ones for AI include:

*IPP 1-4: Collection*
- Only collect personal information for lawful purposes connected to your function
- Collect directly from the individual where possible
- Tell individuals why you're collecting information and how it will be used
- Don't collect more than necessary

*IPP 5: Storage and Security*
- Protect personal information against loss, misuse, and unauthorised access
- AI systems must have appropriate security measures

*IPP 6: Access*
- Individuals can request access to their personal information
- This includes information processed by AI systems

*IPP 7: Correction*
- Individuals can request correction of inaccurate information
- AI training data should be correctable

*IPP 8-11: Use and Disclosure*
- Use information only for purposes it was collected
- Don't keep information longer than necessary
- Don't disclose without appropriate authorisation

**Notifiable Privacy Breaches**
If an AI system is involved in a data breach that poses risk of harm, you must notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals.

### Applying the Privacy Act to AI

**Data for AI Training**
If you provide customer data to train AI models, ensure:
- You have appropriate consent or legitimate basis
- The AI vendor's data practices comply with NZ requirements
- You understand how data will be used and stored

**Automated Decision-Making**
The Act requires transparency about automated decisions affecting individuals:
- Tell people when decisions are made by AI
- Explain the general logic involved
- Allow human review of significant automated decisions

**Cross-Border Transfers**
Many AI tools process data overseas. The Privacy Act allows this only if:
- The overseas recipient protects information comparably to NZ law
- Or the individual authorises the transfer
- Or other exceptions apply

**Practical Steps:**
- Review AI vendor data processing agreements
- Ensure vendors provide adequate privacy protections
- Document your data flows and AI processing
- Update privacy policies to reflect AI use

## Responsible Data Practices

Beyond legal compliance, responsible data practices build trust and reduce risk.

### Data Minimisation

**Principle:** Collect and retain only data you actually need.

**For AI:**
- Don't feed unnecessary personal data into AI systems
- Use anonymised or aggregated data where possible
- Delete data when no longer needed
- Question AI tools that demand excessive data access

### Data Quality

**Principle:** Maintain accurate, current data.

**For AI:**
- AI learns from data—poor data creates poor AI outcomes
- Implement data quality processes
- Allow correction of inaccurate records
- Regularly review and clean data

### Purpose Limitation

**Principle:** Use data only for stated purposes.

**For AI:**
- Don't repurpose customer data for new AI applications without consent
- Be specific about how AI will use data
- Avoid "we might use this for AI someday" data hoarding

### Security

**Principle:** Protect data appropriately.

**For AI:**
- Secure access to AI systems processing sensitive data
- Use encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Control which staff can access AI-processed information
- Monitor for unusual access patterns

## Industry-Specific Considerations

- Who controls data about Māori
- How data benefits or might harm Māori
- Appropriate consultation and consent

### Tikanga
Consider whether AI applications align with tikanga values:
- Manaakitanga: Does AI use support care for people?
- Kaitiakitanga: Are you being a good guardian of data?
- Whanaungatanga: Does AI support or harm relationships?

### Consultation
For AI applications affecting Māori communities:
- Engage with affected communities appropriately
- Seek guidance on culturally appropriate use
- Consider potential for harm or benefit
