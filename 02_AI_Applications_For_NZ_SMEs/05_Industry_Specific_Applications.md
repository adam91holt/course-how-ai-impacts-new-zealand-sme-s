# Industry-Specific AI Applications

While many AI applications work across industries, the most impactful implementations often address challenges specific to particular sectors. This lesson explores AI opportunities across New Zealand's key SME industries, helping you identify applications most relevant to your business.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify AI applications specific to major NZ industries
- Evaluate which industry-specific tools might benefit your business
- Understand how AI addresses unique challenges in different sectors
- Connect general AI capabilities to your industry context

## Hospitality and Food Service

New Zealand's hospitality sector—from cafés to restaurants to hotels—faces unique pressures including staffing challenges, seasonal demand, and thin margins. AI offers several valuable applications.

### Demand Forecasting

AI predicts customer volumes based on:
- Historical patterns (day of week, time of year)
- Weather forecasts
- Local events and holidays
- Booking data
- External factors (cruise ship arrivals, sports events)

**Practical Impact:**
A Queenstown restaurant can accurately predict covers for each service, reducing food waste and optimising staff rostering. Overstaffing wastes wages; understaffing damages service quality and staff wellbeing.

### Menu Engineering

AI analyses sales data to:
- Identify most and least profitable items
- Spot declining trends before items become failures
- Suggest pricing optimisation
- Recommend menu positioning

### Inventory and Waste Management

AI helps manage perishable inventory:
- Predicting ingredient requirements
- Optimising ordering quantities
- Reducing food waste through better planning
- Tracking waste patterns for improvement

Tools like MarketMan and BlueCart incorporate AI for hospitality inventory management.

### Dynamic Pricing

Accommodation providers use AI for dynamic pricing:
- Adjusting rates based on demand
- Responding to competitor pricing
- Maximising revenue during peak periods
- Filling capacity during slow periods

Revenue management systems like RoomPriceGenie are accessible to smaller accommodation providers.

> **NZ Context:** New Zealand's seasonal tourism patterns make AI demand forecasting particularly valuable. The difference between peak season (December-February) and winter can be dramatic in tourist areas.

## Retail and E-commerce

Retail SMEs compete against both global giants and local competitors. AI helps level the playing field.

### Inventory Optimisation

AI balances having enough stock to meet demand against tying up capital in excess inventory:
- Predicting demand by SKU
- Accounting for lead times
- Managing seasonal variations
- Optimising reorder points

For a fashion retailer in Auckland, this might mean accurately predicting winter coat demand months in advance, ensuring the right sizes and styles are in stock when customers want them.

### Personalisation

E-commerce sites use AI to:
- Recommend products based on browsing and purchase history
- Personalise email marketing content
- Customise website experience by visitor
- Predict what customers want before they search

Platforms like Shopify include AI-powered personalisation features accessible to SMEs.

### Visual Search and Recognition

AI can:
- Allow customers to search by uploading images
- Automatically tag and categorise products
- Generate product descriptions from images
- Identify trends in customer preferences

### Pricing Intelligence

AI monitors competitor prices and suggests adjustments:
- Identifying pricing opportunities
- Alerting to competitor changes
- Optimising promotions
- Managing markdown timing

## Trades and Construction

New Zealand's building and trades sectors can leverage AI in ways that directly impact profitability and job quality.

### Quoting and Estimation

AI improves quote accuracy:
- Learning from historical job data
- Accounting for materials cost changes
- Estimating labour requirements
- Identifying risk factors that affect final costs

Accurate quotes win more jobs and protect margins.

### Scheduling and Dispatch

AI optimises job scheduling:
- Routing technicians efficiently
- Matching skills to job requirements
- Estimating job durations
- Managing customer time windows

For a plumbing business running 10 jobs daily, optimised scheduling can add an extra job per day while reducing travel time.

### Safety and Compliance

AI assists with:
- Site safety monitoring via computer vision
- Compliance documentation
- Training record management
- Incident prediction and prevention

### Project Management

AI-enhanced project management tools:
- Predict schedule risks

- Flag potential issues early

## Healthcare and Wellness

Healthcare SMEs—from physiotherapy clinics to dental practices—can improve both clinical and administrative functions with AI.

### Administrative Efficiency

AI handles:
- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- Patient communication
- Insurance claim processing
- Documentation and notes

Many NZ healthcare practices report that AI transcription and note-taking save 30+ minutes per practitioner daily.

### Clinical Decision Support

AI assists (but doesn't replace) clinical judgment:
- Diagnostic suggestions based on symptoms
- Treatment recommendation support
- Drug interaction checking
- Risk assessment tools

> **Important:** Healthcare AI must comply with professional regulations and ethical guidelines. AI assists clinicians but doesn't replace professional judgment. Patient data handling must meet Privacy Act and health information standards.

### Patient Engagement

AI-powered tools:
- Chatbots handling common queries
- Automated post-treatment follow-up
- Personalized health reminders
- Educational content delivery

### Booking and Capacity

AI optimises appointment scheduling:
- Reducing gaps in provider calendars
- Managing waitlists intelligently
- Predicting no-shows and overbooking appropriately
- Matching appointment types to time slots

## Professional Services

Accounting firms, law practices, consultancies, and other professional services benefit from AI that handles routine work, freeing professionals for high-value advisory.

### Document Analysis

AI can:
- Review contracts for key terms and risks
- Extract data from financial statements
- Summarise lengthy documents
- Compare document versions

### Research Assistance

AI accelerates research:
- Finding relevant precedents (legal)
- Identifying applicable standards (accounting)
- Locating market information (consulting)
- Summarising complex materials

### Client Communication

AI assists with:
- Drafting client emails and reports
- Generating first drafts of deliverables
- Creating proposals and engagement letters
- Managing routine client queries

### Knowledge Management

AI helps firms capture and retrieve institutional knowledge:
